2.Driver Installation (Optional)
==================================
This section is not mandatory and is only used when the USB port cannot be recognized by the computer on the development board. If it is already recognized, it can be skipped directly!!!

(Note: If the main board cannot be recognized in Arduino or kidsblock projects, please check whether the board is connected properly, or try other USB port on your computer. If it still does not work, follow these steps to install driver.)
