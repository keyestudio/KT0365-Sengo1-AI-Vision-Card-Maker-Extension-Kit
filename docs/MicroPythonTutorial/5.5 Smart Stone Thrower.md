# 5.5 Smart Stone Thrower

## 5.5.1 Overview

In this project, we build an interesting stone thrower car with automatic recognition by the AI vision module. We first need to mount the module on the car to enable its recognition function. If a human body is detected, the buzzer will emit a countdown beeping from three and then the car will perform a throw. After that, the throwing arm will slowly lower down to wait for the next recognition of a body.

buzzer = PWM(Pin(12))

# Set the PWM frequency to 50Hz (standard servo frequency)

time.sleep(3)

# Select UART or I2C communication mode. Sengo1 is I2C mode by default. You can change it by just pressing the mode button.

## 5.5.5 Test Result

After uploading the code, the AI vision module will activate the “Body” mode and then recognize the captured images to determine if there is a human. If yes, it will perform a throw. Before the throw, there will be three prompt sounds as a countdown. Once the countdown ends, the throw will proceed. After that, the throwing arm will slowly fall back to wait for the next instruction.
